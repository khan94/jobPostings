Project Accomplishments:

Our group managed to accomplish a working database of generated jobs. The interface allows either employers or applicants to sign up. THe users can then sign in through a common interface and gain access to a differing panel of options.

 Employers can view their own job postings, delete jobs, offer job, schedule interviews, see all applicants, and check who applied to a job.

 Applicants can view all jobs, check their interviews, view and update their skills, accept or decline both interviews and job offers.

A sign up Page for each of employers and applicants.

A login page for employers and applicants that interact through the same interface.
