Three slight changes to schema.

1.
	We added an attribute 'accepted' to interviews which could be set as 'y' or 'n'. A 'y' describes a scheduled interview that is scheduled. A 'n' descrives a pending interview offer. In this way we could distinguish between interviews and offers.

2.
	We added a CASCADE description on job_requires_skill's foreign key to job_posting. So if a job_posting is deleted, it's associated skills are deleted as well.

3. 
	Apply does not have interview as part of it's primary key because when applicant first applies, they do not have an intervoew_id.
